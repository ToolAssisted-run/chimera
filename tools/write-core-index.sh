#!/bin/bash
# Publishes a core's version index: the file Chimera reads INSTEAD of asking
# GitHub's API what a core has published.
#
# Why this exists: api.github.com allows an unauthenticated address 60 requests
# an hour, one per core per question, and a 304 costs one exactly as a 200 does.
# Fifteen cores make a single "check for updates" cost fifteen of those, so four
# presses an hour is the whole budget - unusable for anybody developing. A
# release asset costs NOTHING against that limit: downloading one redirects off
# the API entirely. So each core publishes its own answer as an asset.
#
# Per-core rather than one aggregated index, deliberately: the job that creates
# a release is the job that records it, in the same repository, in the same run.
# There is nothing in between for the index to fall behind, so no dispatch to
# miss and no aggregator to break. A core's index cannot go stale with respect
# to that core's releases.
#
# The file is GitHub's own /releases shape, trimmed to the fields the frontend
# reads (CoreReleases.Parse). Keeping the shape means the frontend needs no
# second parser and no schema to keep in step with this script.
#
# It is REGENERATED from the full release list every time, never appended to, so
# a run that failed halfway leaves nothing to reconcile: the next publish writes
# the whole truth again.
#
# It is published as an asset on a PERMANENT release tagged `index`: a release
# that is created once and thereafter only has its asset replaced, never deleted
# and never re-tagged. That keeps one fixed address for the life of the core:
#
#   https://github.com/<repo>/releases/download/index/releases.json
#
# An Actions artifact would have been the obvious home and is the wrong one:
# artifacts expire, and fetching one needs the API and a token, which is the
# cost this exists to avoid. Asset downloads cost nothing against any limit.
#
# The index release excludes itself for free: the filter below keeps only
# .chimeraCore assets, and this release carries none.
#
# Usage: write-core-index.sh --repo owner/name [--tag index]
# Requires: gh (authenticated) and jq.
