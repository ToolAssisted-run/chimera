#!/bin/bash
# Publishes one built core package as a GitHub release of the core's OWN
# repository. Called by .github/workflows/publish-core.yml, which every core's
# CI reuses - the logic lives here, in one file, rather than as fifteen copies
# of the same YAML drifting apart.
#
# Two kinds of release, the same two the frontend publishes (see release.yml):
#
#   dev      a ROLLING prerelease, replaced on every green push to main.
#   nightly  an IMMUTABLE dated release (the newest is GitHub's Latest), published only
#            when main moved. NEVER deleted: a movie cites the core build that
#            recorded it, and someone replaying that run in five years needs
#            THAT package, because a package's identity is a function of its
#            toolchain and the same sources through a later gcc are different
#            bytes.
#
# The asset is named <core-id>-<version>.chimeraCore, and the version is read
# OUT OF THE PACKAGE rather than passed in: it is what the build stamped into
# waterbox.config, it is what a movie cites, and it is what the core manager
# checks the download against. Anything else is a way for the release and the
# package to disagree.
#
# Usage: publish-core.sh --package <file> --core-id <id> [--kind dev|nightly]
#                        [--sha <commit>] [--notes <file>] [--dry-run]
