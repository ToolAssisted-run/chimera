# Downloads the core packages the official cores have published, into
# build/Cores.
#
# Chimera ships no cores and builds none: it is the frontend, and the cores are
# fifteen other repositories that publish themselves (docs/core-manager.md).
# That leaves a hole its own CI has to close - a frontend change could break the
# generic waterbox adapter for every core at once and nothing here would notice
# - so CI fetches what the cores actually published and runs the package
# contract tests against them (InstalledCorePackagesTests).
#
# It is also the quickest way for a developer to get a working set of cores into
# a fresh checkout without opening the frontend.
#
# A core that has published nothing yet is SKIPPED, not an error: cores gain
# their release pipeline one at a time, and a frontend checkout is not broken by
# a core that has not caught up.
#
# Usage: fetch-cores.sh [--kind nightly|dev] [--out <dir>] [--core <id>]... [--list]
