Chimera is a minimal frontend for creating tool-assisted speedruns (TAS).

## Goals

- **Modularity.** The frontend contains no emulation core and no system-specific knowledge. Cores are external, self-contained packages (`.chimeraCore`), each maintained in its own repository under its own license, loaded explicitly like a ROM.

- **Performance.** All functional machinery (the sandbox host, movies, savestates, file formats, the running machine itself) lives in `libchimera`, a native C++ engine the GUI calls into.

- **Stronger reproducibility guarantees.** A movie's reproduction contract is the pair *(movie, core package)*: nothing about a Chimera build (compiler, libraries, OS) is allowed to affect whether a movie syncs. Movies record the exact core version, package hash, firmware hashes, and host provenance.

Chimera is not designed for casual play. For that, use the original emulators directly, or a multi-emulation frontend such as RetroArch.

## Supported systems

Chimera ships **no cores**. Each is a separate project with its own repository,
its own release history and its own licence; you install the ones you want from
inside Chimera, through **File > Core Manager**, which downloads them from the
projects below and checks each download against what that project published.
See [docs/core-manager.md](docs/core-manager.md).

## Getting a build

The frontend is built for Linux and Windows and published here:

- [**Latest development build**](https://github.com/ToolAssisted-run/chimera/releases/tag/dev) - rebuilt on every change to `main` that passes the gates, and replaced each time. Nothing is published that did not pass them. **Not for submissions:** a dev build is replaced on every change, so it may stop being downloadable and a movie made on it can stop being replayable. Do not use one to produce a TAS for submission to toolAssisted.run - use a nightly.
- [**Nightly builds**](https://github.com/ToolAssisted-run/chimera/releases) - dated, immutable, and kept forever. Cite one of these in a bug report or beside a movie: a run is only reproducible while the build that recorded it still exists, and this is what a TAS submitted to toolAssisted.run should be made on.

A bundle carries no cores. Open **File > Core Manager** and download what you
want; a fresh install opens it for you, since a Chimera with no core cannot
open anything. Each core publishes its own `dev` and nightly releases the same
way, and its nightlies are never deleted - which is what lets a movie name the
exact package that recorded it and still be replayable years later.

Every bundle carries `BUILD.txt`, naming the exact commit it was built from, and
`LICENSES.md`, stating its terms. **Installing a core adds that core's terms**,
and some of them (Genesis Plus GX, Opera, Snes9x) forbid commercial use, which
binds whatever they are installed into; Chimera shows a core's licence once it
is installed.

Core packages published before the split are kept in the
[`cores`](https://github.com/ToolAssisted-run/chimera/releases/tag/cores)
release, named by SHA1. It no longer grows - each core archives its own now -
but movies recorded then still cite packages in it.

## Building

The canonical build is Linux-hosted and meson-mediated, and produces the artifacts for both operating systems: the managed frontend is built once (platform-neutral IL, .NET Framework on Windows / Mono on Linux), and every native library is built twice: gcc for Linux, mingw-w64 cross for Windows. Clone with `--recursive`; the repository contains no precompiled binaries, and
no cores - `tools/fetch-cores.sh` puts the published ones in `build/Cores` if
you want a working set without opening the frontend.

```
meson setup build/meson-linux   --prefix "$(pwd)/build" --libdir dll
meson setup build/meson-windows --prefix "$(pwd)/build" --libdir dll --cross-file extern/meson/mingw-w64.ini
meson compile -C build/meson-linux && meson install -C build/meson-linux
meson compile -C build/meson-windows && meson install -C build/meson-windows
meson compile -C build/meson-linux frontend   # the managed solution (dotnet)
```

Linux requirements: meson, ninja, cmake, gcc, mingw-w64, and Microsoft's own .NET SDK binary (`curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash -s -- --channel 8.0`); distro-built SDKs omit the WindowsDesktop targets the net48/WinForms frontend needs.

The frontend ships no cores, so get at least one before running it - either the
published packages, or a core repository cloned wherever you like:

```
tools/fetch-cores.sh                                # every published core -> build/Cores
<core checkout>/waterbox/build-package.sh -r $PWD   # or build one yourself
tools/build-bundle.sh --platform linux --out <dir>  # the distributable (no cores)
```

To run: `build\Chimera.exe` on Windows, `build/ChimeraMono.sh` on Linux, then
`File > New Project...` and pick a core. To play a rom with no project, pass
`--core=<package> <rom>` on the command line.

The witness gate runs with `tests/synth/run-witness.sh`. The engineering log (objectives, procedure, and the sharp edges found along the way) is in [docs/design-principles.md](docs/design-principles.md); the engine migration is chronicled in [docs/engine-migration.md](docs/engine-migration.md). Building a new core, and joining it to this bundle, is [docs/porting-a-core.md](docs/porting-a-core.md).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, from people and from people working with AI assistants alike. A contribution is judged on its merits: it should build, pass the witness gate, and keep to the project's scope. The one firm requirement is legal cleanliness: you must have the right to submit the code under this repository's MIT license, and anything derived from other works must respect their licenses and carry the attribution they require.
