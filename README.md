## Getting a build

Chimera and its officially maintained cores are built together, for Linux and
Windows, and published here:

- [**Latest development build**](https://github.com/ToolAssisted-run/chimera/releases/tag/dev) - rebuilt on every change to `main` that passes the gates, and replaced each time. Nothing is published that did not pass them.
- [**Nightly builds**](https://github.com/ToolAssisted-run/chimera/releases) - dated, immutable, and kept forever. Cite one of these in a bug report or beside a movie: a run is only reproducible while the build that recorded it still exists.

Every distinct core package is kept forever too, in the
[`cores`](https://github.com/ToolAssisted-run/chimera/releases/tag/cores)
release, named by its own SHA1 - which is what a movie cites, since what a
replay has to match is the core rather than the frontend around it.

Every bundle carries `BUILD.txt`, naming the exact commit of the frontend and of
every core in it, and `LICENSES.md`, stating the terms of the whole thing.
**Those terms are non-commercial**, because some of the cores' licences are.

## Goals

These are the reasons Chimera exists as its own project rather than a BizHawk configuration:

- **Modularity.** The frontend contains no emulation core and no system-specific knowledge. Cores are external, self-contained packages (`.chimeraCore`), each maintained in its own repository under its own license, loaded explicitly like a ROM.

- **Performance.** All functional machinery (the sandbox host, movies, savestates, file formats, the running machine itself) lives in `libchimera`, a native C++ engine the GUI calls into.

- **Stronger reproducibility guarantees.** A movie's reproduction contract is the pair *(movie, core package)*: nothing about a Chimera build (compiler, libraries, OS) is allowed to affect whether a movie syncs. Movies record the exact core version, package hash, firmware hashes, and host provenance.

Chimera is not designed for casual play. For that, use the original emulators directly, or a multi-emulation frontend such as RetroArch.

## Building

The canonical build is Linux-hosted and meson-mediated, and produces the artifacts for both operating systems: the managed frontend is built once (platform-neutral IL, .NET Framework on Windows / Mono on Linux), and every native library is built twice: gcc for Linux, mingw-w64 cross for Windows. Clone with `--recursive`; the repository contains no precompiled binaries.

```
meson setup build/meson-linux   --prefix "$(pwd)/build" --libdir dll
meson setup build/meson-windows --prefix "$(pwd)/build" --libdir dll --cross-file extern/tools/meson/mingw-w64.ini
meson compile -C build/meson-linux && meson install -C build/meson-linux
meson compile -C build/meson-windows && meson install -C build/meson-windows
meson compile -C build/meson-linux frontend   # the managed solution (dotnet)
```

Linux requirements: meson, ninja, cmake, gcc, mingw-w64, and Microsoft's own .NET SDK binary (`curl -sSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash -s -- --channel 8.0`); distro-built SDKs omit the WindowsDesktop targets the net48/WinForms frontend needs.

The frontend ships no cores, so build at least one before running it. Each lives
in `extern/cores/` and installs itself into `build/Cores/`:

```
extern/cores/quickernes/waterbox/build-package.sh   # one core
tools/build-bundle.sh --platform linux --out <dir>  # or the whole distributable
```

To run: `build\Chimera.exe` on Windows, `build/ChimeraMono.sh` on Linux, then
`File > New Project...` and pick a core. To play a rom with no project, pass
`--core=<package> <rom>` on the command line.

The witness gate runs with `tests/synth/run-witness.sh`. The engineering log (objectives, procedure, and the sharp edges found along the way) is in [docs/design-principles.md](docs/design-principles.md); the engine migration is chronicled in [docs/engine-migration.md](docs/engine-migration.md).

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, from people and from people working with AI assistants alike. A contribution is judged on its merits: it should build, pass the witness gate, and keep to the project's scope. The one firm requirement is legal cleanliness: you must have the right to submit the code under this repository's MIT license, and anything derived from other works must respect their licenses and carry the attribution they require.

## Credits and license
