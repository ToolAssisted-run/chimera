# The Chimera project: TAS-only refocus

Decided with the user 2026-08-26. Chimera is a TAS tool, not a frontend for
casual gaming. There is exactly one use case: open a project, work in
TAStudio. Everything below follows from that.

## The entry point

Chimera's entry point is not "load core" nor "load rom": it is the project.
The GUI opens on a start screen - New Chimera Project, Open Project, recent
projects - and nothing else. Creating or opening a project leads directly
into TAStudio; TAStudio is no longer a tool among others, it is the
application. The casual paths are fully removed: no Load ROM menu, no
runtime Emulator > Core picker, no live sync-settings dialogs. Core
development and debugging needs are covered headlessly by chimera-run,
which learns to take a project file.

## What a project is

A single JSON file (extension `.chimeraProject`) that contains literally
everything required to reproduce the work, except the data bytes
themselves, which are named by their SHA1:

- **Core identity**: package name, version, hash - pinned at creation.
- **File manifest**: names + SHA1 + the core-defined slot id each file
  fills (cdrom, floppy, hdd, config, ...), order within a slot = swap
  order, cue-referenced bins auto-added as support, cue closure enforced.
  The generic image/support/savedata role triple retires; opening
  validates the manifest against the core's slot declaration. The
  standalone `.chimeraMultiFile` format does not survive as a GUI-facing
  concept; the engine's `ce_multifile_*` code evolves into this section,
  and headless descriptors remain available during the transition.
- **Firmware**: resolved at creation, pinned by hash.
- **Sync settings**: defined once, in the creation wizard.
- **The TAS work itself**: input log, markers, branches. The project IS
  the movie; publishing a finished TAS means handing over the project
  file, and anyone holding files matching the SHA1s can reproduce
  everything.

Not in the project:

- **Paths.** Never stored. Only names and SHA1s.
- **Greenzone / cached states.** A sibling cache file next to the project;
  if present it is loaded, otherwise the session starts from a clean
  state-memory slate. Losing it costs recomputation, never work.
- **Per-user preferences.** Keybinds, window layout, hotkeys stay in user
  config; the project holds only what affects sync and reproduction.

## Creation

One wizard, everything at once. Step one asks project title, emulation
core, and project description. Step two asks for the files - and it is
NOT a blind "add any files" dialog: it is a fully core-informed form.
The core declares categories (CD-ROMs, floppy disks, hard disk,
configuration files, save states, ...), each rendered as empty slots with
a cardinality (exactly 1, 0-N, 1+), the accepted formats, and a small
circled question-mark tooltip explaining what is expected there and in
what format. The form's content is fully decided, populated and formatted
by each core; Chimera only provides the interface and the execution. Files
are hashed as they are added, and order within a category is the swap
order. The form ADAPTS within the step: a slot may carry "exposedWhen"
over the current picks, so providing a Famicom disk greys the cartridge
slot until the disk is unloaded and vice versa - greyed, never hidden,
so the person still sees what the machine could also take. An
unavailable slot's minimum does not bind, which is how two mutually
exclusive min-1 slots together say "exactly one of either". Then the sync settings - themselves GATED by the files just chosen: a
declaration entry may carry "exposedWhen" (the same condition language
as firmware), so a Game Gear cart exposes its sound chip where a
Genesis cart exposes its own, a Famicom disk exposes the FDS BIOS
choice where a cartridge shows nothing, and a setting may gate further
settings (re-evaluated live as values change). Same-name variants are
separate entries with disjoint conditions, exactly like firmware. The
project records every EXPOSED sync setting explicitly at its effective
value - the settings section is exactly the knobs the decisions
offered, nothing else. And LAST, the firmware - last because everything
before it has a say: the core itself may need a file regardless of
anything else, the chosen game files may trigger a need (a Famicom disk
needs the FDS bios where a cartridge does not; a CD image needs the CD
bios where a cart does not), and the sync settings may too (a region
choice selects between region bioses; a font-source choice turns a
bundled freebie into a real-BIOS requirement). The core dictates that
logic entirely, as a decision tree in its waterbox.config "firmware"
declaration; the wizard only renders the result and collects the files.
On create, TAStudio opens at frame 0.

### The firmware decision tree

A firmware entry in waterbox.config may carry "requiredWhen", a
condition over the slot map and the EFFECTIVE (defaults-overlaid)
settings:

```json
{ "id": "bios_cd_us", "display": "Sega CD BIOS (US)",
  "requiredWhen": { "all": [
    { "slot": "cd" },
    { "setting": "region", "is": "us" }
  ] } }
```

- `{"slot": id}`: the slot holds at least one file;
  `{"slot": id, "extension": "cue"}`: ...a file with that extension.
- `{"setting": name, "is": v}`: the setting has that value (compared by
  its declared type); `{"setting": name, "in": [v...]}`: one of those.
- `{"all": [...]}`, `{"any": [...]}`, `{"not": {...}}` combine freely.
- A conditional entry is required when its condition holds and absent
  otherwise; an entry without a condition keeps its legacy "required"
  flag (false = shown as optional). A malformed condition evaluates
  false - a core that misdeclares asks for nothing, never for
  everything.

The engine evaluates (ce_firmware_evaluate), everywhere the question is
asked: the wizard's last page, and the core factory at load time - a
required file the user never provided stops the load with its name.

The decisions nail each requirement to ONE exact file, or to nothing.
There is no optional firmware and nothing to choose between: variants
of one file are separate declaration entries sharing an id, with
disjoint conditions a sync setting selects between ("FDS BIOS to Use:
Nintendo", "System Fonts: sony") - a choice that needs no firmware
simply produces no requirement ("System Fonts: bundled"). An entry
names its one dump openly: {"sha1", "name", "label"} - the SHA1 is the
identity, the name only a hint of what the file is usually called. An
entry may omit the hash only for a file no one can pin (a dump only
the user can own); the chosen file's actual hash is recorded.

The wizard's firmware page inspects the Firmware folder (a path entry)
FIRST, so a dump dropped there once satisfies wizards forever: every
plausible file is hashed and matched, and a satisfied requirement
shows its checkmark and the file in use. A per-item Select File button
covers what the folder could not - allowed even when something was
found - and only the exact file satisfies. Create stays DISABLED until
every requirement is satisfied.

The project records the chosen files as pins ("firmware": [{"id",
"sha1"}]), actual hashes as always; the frontend remembers paths
per-user in its config, never in the project. REOPENING is stricter
than creation: each pin must be matched exactly, by hash, from the
Firmware folder or the remembered paths - whichever file matches is
what the session mounts - and a pin nothing satisfies takes a severe
are-you-sure (different firmware is a different machine: expect
desync) to get past.

The declaration lives in a static file generated at core build time and
shipped in the core package - the same pattern as `waterbox.config` for
settings and `default_keybinds.json` for binds. The wizard reads it with
no guest boot, and the declaration is versioned with the core.

### The slot declaration: file_slots.json

One file per core package, beside `waterbox.config`. Read by the wizard
to build the form, and by `ce_project_*` to validate a manifest:

```json
{
  "slots": [
    {
      "id": "floppy",
      "title": "Floppy disks",
      "min": 0,
      "max": -1,
      "formats": ["img", "ima", "xdf", "fdi", "hdm", "nfd", "d88"],
      "help": "what belongs here and in which format (the tooltip text)"
    }
  ],
  "atLeastOneOf": [["floppy", "cdrom", "hdd", "conf"]]
}
```

- `id`: bare lowercase token, unique within the core. This is what a
  manifest entry records as its slot, and what mount naming derives
  from.
- `title`: the category heading the form shows.
- `min` / `max`: cardinality; `max` -1 means unbounded. Exactly one =
  1/1, zero or more = 0/-1, one or more = 1/-1.
- `formats`: accepted file extensions, lowercase without the dot; the
  wizard filters file pickers by them and validation checks membership.
  An extension may legitimately appear in several slots (`.img` is a
  floppy or a hard disk - the user's slot choice resolves what
  sniffing had to guess).
- `help`: the circled-question-mark tooltip text.
- `exposedWhen` (optional): the condition language above, evaluated over
  the CURRENT slot map (settings do not take part - the files come
  first in the wizard). The form re-evaluates after every add and
  remove, greying slots the condition rules out; `ce_project_validate`
  enforces the same rule (a file in an unexposed slot is a structural
  error), and exposure is decided before cardinality so an unexposed
  slot's `min` does not bind.
- `atLeastOneOf` (optional): groups of slot ids; across each group at
  least one file must be present, for requirements no single slot's
  `min` can express ("some bootable medium").
- `support` is a reserved id: files referenced by a listed cue are
  auto-added to the manifest with slot `support`; a core never declares
  it.

## Editing

Anything in a project can be changed after it is opened, with one
exception: the core. The core selection is fixed at creation - a
different core means a new project. A **structural** change - one that
affects sync: sync settings, the file manifest - first asks: "this will
erase the greenzone and possibly desync your current inputs, are you
sure?". On yes: the greenzone is cleared, the core restarts, and the
frame selector returns to frame 0. The input log is kept (it may no
longer sync; that is the user's informed call). Non-structural changes
(title, description, markers, ...) apply freely.

## Opening

Opening a project first shows a file-resolution dialog: the user provides
the location of every required file for this session (locations are
per-session, wherever the files happen to live). As each file is provided
its SHA1 is checked and divergence is warned about immediately, in the
dialog. A differing file NAME on disk is fine - the project's recorded
name is the canonical label and mount name, the hash is the identity.

Core pin mismatch (installed package differs from the pinned
version+hash): refuse by default with a clear pinned-vs-installed message,
with a knowing override - and the project then records what actually ran,
mirroring the file-hash posture.

## Architecture decisions

- **Serializer in the engine**: `ce_project_*` in libchimera reads,
  writes and validates the project (manifest, core pin, settings, input
  log, markers, branches), evolving `ce_multifile_*` and the
  engine-resident input log. chimera-run and every gate consume projects
  for free; C# only renders UI over it.
- **Movie code is absorbed**: the engine's input-log/movie code becomes
  the project's input-log section and the standalone movie format retires
  from the GUI. Headless chimera-run and the gates keep old movie files
  working during the transition, then migrate to projects.

## Status

- Decided: everything above.
- DONE: file_slots.json in all four core packages; ce_project_* in the
  engine (open/save/resolve/validate/slots map) with test_project;
  chimera-run --project (resolution, core pin, declaration validation,
  transitional rom mounts); cores consume the "slots" mount through the
  guest kit's waterbox_slots.h - DOSBox-X mounts mixed media (floppies +
  CDs + hard disk + conf, gated: the slots leg, 12/12), PPSSPP boots the
  disc slot, both NES cores read the rom slot.
- TODO: the frontend (start screen, creation wizard rendering
  file_slots.json, resolution dialog, TAStudio-as-application, removal
  of the casual paths); PPSSPP memstick-zip import and NES SRAM import
  as future savedata-consuming slots; retiring the transitional
  rom/rom.name/rom2..N mounts once nothing legacy needs them.
