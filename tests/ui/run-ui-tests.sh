# Runs Chimera's automated tests, including the ones that build real windows.
#
# There are two kinds and they are deliberately separate:
#   - Chimera.Tests.* : logic. No display, no emulator, no core. Everything a
#     machine can decide about the frontend's behaviour should end up here.
#   - Chimera.Tests.Client.GUI : windows. Constructs forms and drives them
#     (tick a row, press a button) to check the wiring between the widgets and
#     that logic. Needs an X display; on a headless box that is Xvfb.
#
# Neither kind can tell you a window LOOKS right. For that, --shots renders the
# windows to PNGs under tests/ui/shots/ for a person to look at.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run-ui-tests.sh              # every test project
#   ./run-ui-tests.sh --shots      # ...and write screenshots to tests/ui/shots
#   ./run-ui-tests.sh --only-ui    # just the window tests

# This gate runs what is BUILT in build/tests, never the sources, and that has
# lied in both directions. An edit that was not built shows up as failures in
# tests that are perfectly fine - fifty-six phantom ones on 2026-09-20 - with
# nothing in the output naming the build. And a project whose exe is missing
# printed "SKIP (not built)" and did not count, so a project that failed to
# compile left the gate green: with build/tests empty the run reported four
# SKIPs and exited 0, having run no tests at all.
#
# Refuse both, and say the command that fixes them. Refusing rather than
# building: build/tests has no configuration in its path (TestProjects.props),
# so Debug and Release land in the same directory and a build from here would
# quietly replace one with the other.
