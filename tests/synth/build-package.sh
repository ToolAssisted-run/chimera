# Builds the waterboxed Synth core package and the test roms, and installs the
# package into <ChimeraRoot>/build/Cores/.
#
# Chimera is WATERBOX-ONLY: the only shipped core package is the waterboxed
# flavor. A package is just core.wbx (fixed name) + waterbox.config; it is loaded
# by Chimera's built-in generic WaterboxCore adapter through libminiboxhost,
# which ships with the frontend in build/dll (see the root meson.build). There is
# no per-core managed assembly, manifest, or natives list.
#
# native/ (synthcore.c + synth-run) is kept ONLY as the offline golden generator
# for the witness (built by run-witness.sh); it is not a core.
#
# Prereq: the frontend has been built (build/dll has libminiboxhost + the contract
# DLLs including the built-in WaterboxCore).
#
# Usage: ./build-package.sh [-c Configuration] [-r ChimeraRoot]
