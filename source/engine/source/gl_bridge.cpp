/* The engine's side of the GPU bridge: a real GL context, and the dispatcher a
 * sandboxed core reaches it through.
 *
 * A core that wants a GPU cannot have one. It runs in a sandbox with no
 * syscalls, no libraries and no driver, and the only thing it may call out to
 * is one callback the host registers with miniBox - six integers in, one out.
 * So its renderer's GL calls arrive here as (opcode, pointer to an argument
 * block in GUEST memory), and this answers them on a context the engine owns.
 * The guest's memory is this process's memory, so the arguments - and the
 * vertex data and textures they point at - are read in place, uncopied. That
 * is what makes it affordable.
 *
 * The opcodes are miniBox's (extern/chimera-common-minibox/source/gl),
 * shared by every core and this host, and the list is append-only so a core
 * built against an older copy still means what it meant. A guest asks how long
 * our list is and declines us if we are behind it.
 *
 * TRAFFIC IS ONE-WAY. The guest may hand us pointers into its memory; we may
 * never hand back a pointer into ours, because the sandbox stops the guest
 * reading it - and is right to. Anything GL returns by pointer is copied into a
 * buffer the guest supplied.
 *
 * THE CONTEXT IS BORROWED, NEVER KEPT. "Current context" is one slot per
 * thread, and the frontend draws its own picture through it. Holding ours
 * across a return would take that slot away - and worse, take it away
 * INVISIBLY: a frontend that binds its context through SDL is short-circuited
 * by SDL's own cache ("already current") and never rebinds, so it goes on
 * drawing into a hidden 64x64 window forever. That is a black screen with
 * working sound, and it is what happened on Windows the first time this ran
 * against a real display. So: borrow at the first call of a frame, put back
 * exactly what was there when the frame ends (ce_gl_release).
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS. The GPU is outside the sandbox: outside the savestate,
 * outside the determinism the rest of a core is built on, and different on
 * every machine. A session drawn this way says so (ce_session_deterministic
 * turns 0) and a movie recorded on it carries a header saying a GPU drew, so
 * that a replay that desyncs somewhere else can be understood rather than
 * merely suffered.

 * on the software one the gate uses, which is exactly how a padding difference
 * would behave.

 * buffer sized generously for what it might write, with a canary past the bytes
 * the guest asked for, and exactly those bytes are copied on to the guest. A

 * Buffer names, recycled.
 *
 * Measured on a GTX 1060 (Ruffle, New Star Soccer): a hundred and thirty-nine
 * buffers created, filled with glBufferData, and deleted EVERY FRAME - the
 * counts pair exactly - costing 1.74 ms in glGenBuffers alone. Twelve
 * microseconds a call, for an entry point that is supposed to do nothing but
 * reserve a name.
 *
 * It does nothing but reserve a name when the driver is idle. It is not idle:
 * the buffers being deleted are ones the GPU is still reading, so the delete
 * is deferred and the next reservation waits behind that queue. The churn pays
 * for itself twice over.
 *
 * So a deleted buffer's name is kept rather than given back to the driver, and
 * the next request for one is answered from that list. Three things make this
 * safe rather than clever:
 *
 *  - a recycled buffer is RE-SPECIFIED before use. Every one of those
 *    hundred and thirty-nine is followed by a glBufferData, which replaces its
 *    size and its contents outright and orphans whatever the GPU still held.
 *    (Immutable storage would not allow that, but a guest across this bridge
 *    cannot have ARB_buffer_storage - it hands out a host pointer - so the
 *    mutable path is the only path here.)
 *  - only names this bridge HANDED OUT are pooled. A guest deleting something
 *    it never generated is a guest with a bug, and passing that through to the
 *    driver is how it stays visible.
 *  - the list is bounded. Past the cap the delete is a real delete, so a guest
 *    that frees far more than it allocates cannot make this a leak.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is textures, and the reason is worth recording: they are
 * created with glTexStorage2D, which is immutable. A recycled texture would
 * have to be handed back for exactly the shape it already has, and the shape is
 * not known until the call AFTER the one that has to choose. Doing it properly
 * means translating texture names throughout the bridge, which is a great deal
 * of surface for the megabyte-a-frame this would save.
