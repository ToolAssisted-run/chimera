/* The engine's side of the GPU bridge: a real GL context, and the dispatcher a
 * sandboxed core reaches it through.
 *
 * A core that wants a GPU cannot have one. It runs in a sandbox with no
 * syscalls, no libraries and no driver, and the only thing it may call out to
 * is one callback the host registers with miniBox - six integers in, one out.
 * So its renderer's GL calls arrive here as (opcode, pointer to an argument
 * block in GUEST memory), and this answers them on a context the engine owns.
 * The guest's memory is this process's memory, so the arguments - and the
 * vertex data and textures they point at - are read in place, uncopied. That
 * is what makes it affordable.
 *
 * The opcodes are miniBox's (extern/tools/chimera-common-minibox/source/gl),
 * shared by every core and this host, and the list is append-only so a core
 * built against an older copy still means what it meant. A guest asks how long
 * our list is and declines us if we are behind it.
 *
 * TRAFFIC IS ONE-WAY. The guest may hand us pointers into its memory; we may
 * never hand back a pointer into ours, because the sandbox stops the guest
 * reading it - and is right to. Anything GL returns by pointer is copied into a
 * buffer the guest supplied.
 *
 * THE CONTEXT IS BORROWED, NEVER KEPT. "Current context" is one slot per
 * thread, and the frontend draws its own picture through it. Holding ours
 * across a return would take that slot away - and worse, take it away
 * INVISIBLY: a frontend that binds its context through SDL is short-circuited
 * by SDL's own cache ("already current") and never rebinds, so it goes on
 * drawing into a hidden 64x64 window forever. That is a black screen with
 * working sound, and it is what happened on Windows the first time this ran
 * against a real display. So: borrow at the first call of a frame, put back
 * exactly what was there when the frame ends (ce_gl_release).
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS. The GPU is outside the sandbox: outside the savestate,
 * outside the determinism the rest of a core is built on, and different on
 * every machine. A session drawn this way says so (ce_session_deterministic
 * turns 0) and a movie recorded on it carries a header saying a GPU drew, so
 * that a replay that desyncs somewhere else can be understood rather than
 * merely suffered.
