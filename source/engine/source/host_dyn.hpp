/* host_dyn.hpp - libminiboxhost, loaded at runtime from beside the engine,

 * A waterbox guest is ALWAYS sysv64 - it is a Linux ELF, whatever the host
 * runs on. On Linux that matches us and guest entry points are called
 * directly. On Windows the engine speaks win64, so a guest entry point is
 * wrapped in a stub that routes through the host's departN trampolines -
 * the same mechanism the C# WaterboxAbiShim used.
