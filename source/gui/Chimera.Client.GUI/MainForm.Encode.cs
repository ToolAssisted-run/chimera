	/// getting the order wrong produced a file that was empty, short or never

	/// frame asked for, reproduces it as fast as the machine will go, writes each
	/// frame out, closes the file, and puts the emulator back exactly where the
	/// person left it.
	///
	/// The run loop drives it. <see cref="StepRunLoop_Core"/> already knows how to
	/// emulate a frame, dump it and keep the sound fed; a job only makes that
	/// happen every iteration, unthrottled, and decides when to stop. Nothing here
	/// emulates anything itself, which is what keeps the encoded frames identical
	/// to the played ones.
