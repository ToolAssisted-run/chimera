	/// Tools &gt; Cache Manager: everything Chimera keeps on disk that it could work
	/// out again, and how much room it is taking.
	///
	/// One rule makes this window safe, and it is worth stating where somebody can
	/// read it: losing a cache costs RECOMPUTATION, never work. Every row here can
	/// be deleted and the worst that happens is waiting - a run replays instead of
	/// resuming, a package is unzipped again, a game's code is translated again.
	/// Nothing that cannot be rebuilt appears: installed cores belong to the Core
	/// Manager, because a movie needs the exact build that recorded it, and
	/// projects, roms and firmware are not caches at all.
	///
	/// TICKING is for doing the same thing to several rows; SELECTING is for
	/// looking closely at one - the same division the Core Manager draws. So
	/// Remove acts on what is ticked, and Open Folder on what is highlighted.
	/// Lock / Unlock is a ticked-rows act too, which is what makes "keep these
	/// four runs and let the rest go" one press instead of four.
	///
	/// The window also owns the limit the cache is held under, because this is
	/// where somebody looking at what it weighs already is. A padlock is only
	/// ever about the AUTO-clean: a locked entry is still removed by Remove, on
	/// the grounds that ticking a row and pressing it is not something anybody
	/// does by accident.
	///
	/// Thin over <see cref="CacheSurvey"/>, like the firmware windows are over
	/// their surveys: what is listed, what it costs and what may not be deleted
	/// are the model's, which is tested without a UI, and this arranges it.
