	/// Where this machine keeps a project's files, remembered beside it.
	///
	/// A .chimeraProject is meant to be handed to someone else: it names files
	/// by name and hash and never by path, because a path is true of one machine
	/// and nowhere else (docs/project.md). But the machine that MADE the project
	/// knows where those files are, and asking it again every time you open your
	/// own work is friction for nothing.
	///
	/// So the paths are remembered - never distributed, and never read as
	/// authority. They are hints. Every path one offers is checked: the file must
	/// still be there and still hash to what the project records, and anything
	/// that fails simply falls through to the usual resolution, which is what
	/// happens on a machine that has never seen the project. Losing them costs
	/// nothing but the asking.
	///
	/// They live in the per-user cache (<see cref="ProjectCache"/>), keyed by the
	/// project's id, rather than in a sibling file. A .chimeraProject is the one
	/// file that exists as far as anyone else is concerned - it is what gets
	/// handed over and what a cloud folder syncs - so nothing that can be
	/// recomputed belongs beside it. A sidecar found next to an older project is
	/// read once and moved here, so nothing anybody had is lost.
