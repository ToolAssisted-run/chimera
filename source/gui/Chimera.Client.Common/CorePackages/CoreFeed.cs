	/// Asks a core's GitHub repository what versions of it exist.
	///
	/// Nothing here ever runs on its own. Chimera does not poll, does not check at
	/// startup, and makes no request until somebody presses Download or Check for
	/// updates - so the whole of this class is on a path a person started.
	///
	/// It asks the core, not GitHub's API. Each core's publish job attaches a
	/// releases.json to a permanent release on its own repository
	/// (tools/write-core-index.sh) and this downloads that asset.
	///
	/// The API was the obvious way and is unusable: 60 requests an hour per
	/// ADDRESS, one per core per question, and a 304 charged exactly like a 200
	/// (measured 2026-09-07). Fifteen cores make one press of Check for updates
	/// cost fifteen, so four presses is the hour's entire budget - which anybody
	/// developing exhausts before lunch, and which a shared address exhausts on
	/// somebody else's behalf. A release asset costs nothing at all: it redirects
	/// off the API entirely.
	///
	/// There is no fallback to the API, on purpose. A fallback would hide the case
	/// this has to get right - a core whose index is missing - behind a path that
	/// works four times an hour and then mysteriously stops.
	///
	/// The ETag cache below no longer buys anything against a limit; it saves the
	/// bandwidth, and it is what lets an offline manager list what it saw last time.
