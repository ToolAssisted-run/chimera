	/// <summary>
	/// This class will manage savestates for TAStudio, with a very similar API as <see cref="ZwinderStateManager"/>.
	/// <br/>This manager intends to address a shortcoming of Zwinder, which is that it could not accept states out of order.
	/// Allowing states to be added out of order has two primary benefits:
	/// <br/>1. Users who load a branch, emulate forward a little, then rewind can still use the full buffer space.
	/// <br/>2. It becomes much easier to "thin out" states (keeping only a subset of them) for saving and to then use them again on load.
	/// <br/><br/>
	/// Out of order states also means we do not need separately allocated buffers for "current", "recent", etc.
	/// This gives us some more flexibility, but still there won't be any one-size-fits-all strategy for state management.
	/// <br/>For the initial implementation I will be using similar settings as Zwinder has, but this may change in the future.
	/// <br/>Additionally, this approach allows us to take the main goals of <see cref="ZwinderBuffer"/> into a state manager:
	/// <br/>1. No copies, ever. States are deposited directly to, and read directly from, one giant buffer (assuming no TempFile storage, which is not currently implemented).
	/// <br/>2. Support for arbitrary and changeable state sizes.

			// 1) "new": This is similar to Zwinder's "current". It will hold the most recent (highest frame number) states.
			// 2) "mid": This is similar to Zwinder's "recent". It will hold states older than "new".
			// 3) "old": This is similar to Zwinder's "ancient". It will hold states that should never be thrown out for being "old" (low frame number relative to the ones in "new").
			// Instead of having a group like Zwinder's "gap" we will take from the "mid" group.

			// The defaults given here are largely arbitrary. There is no one-size-fits-all and so we make no attempt to fine-tune the defaults.
