	/// <summary>
	/// Which cached things the auto-clean is not allowed to take.
	///
	/// The auto-clean removes the oldest entries when the cache goes over its
	/// limit, and "oldest" is a decent rule that is occasionally exactly wrong:
	/// the run somebody put a fortnight into and has not opened this month is
	/// both the oldest thing on disk and the one it would hurt most to lose. A
	/// lock is how that gets said. It is the ONLY thing it says - a locked entry
	/// can still be removed by hand in the cache manager, because a person who
	/// ticks a row and presses Remove has already decided.
	///
	/// The defaults follow which way round the mistake would matter. A greenzone
	/// is unlocked: it is the big thing, it is what a limit exists to bound, and
	/// losing one costs a replay. Everything else - unpacked cores, compiled
	/// code, the version index - starts locked: it is small enough that evicting
	/// it frees nothing worth having, and losing it stalls the next boot for no
	/// gain. So the limit falls where the room actually goes, and the little
	/// things stay put unless somebody says otherwise. Unsaved work (a project's
	/// recovery journal) starts locked for the opposite reason: it is the one
	/// entry whose loss is work rather than time.
	///
	/// Kept beside the caches rather than inside them, and keyed by location: a
	/// core package directory is unzipped from a package and must stay exactly
	/// what the package said it was, so nothing of Chimera's own goes in it.
	/// Locations are machine-local and so is this file, which is the same thing
	/// the caches themselves are.
	///
	/// One file with one writer: setting a lock reads the book, changes what it
	/// was asked about and writes the whole thing back. Two Chimeras open at once
	/// could talk over each other and the later save would win, which is a lost
	/// padlock and not a lost run - not worth a lock file to prevent.
